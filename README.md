Why flashcards?

Neuroscientists sometimes categorize intelligence into two factors:

1. fluid intelligence
2. crystallized intelligence

The first one sounds pretty awesome, right? We all want lots of that. And there are plenty of apps to help with that. Crystal focuses on the second one - crystallized intelligence. It's for accumulating and then cementing *volumes* of knowledge. That's what we want to build here.
