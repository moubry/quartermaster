### Why flashcards?

Details matter.

You've been there. Maybe it's at work: you see a fellow developer write some verbose code when there's a shorter, more elegant way to achieve the same thing. You recommend the alternative, which makes the code better; you get more respect from your fellow developers, which makes you feel good.

Or maybe you're in a technical interview for a job. Never has knowing a technical nuance been more critical to acquiring happiness.

### What's with the name?

From the New Oxford American Dictionary:

> **quartermaster** *|ˈkwôrtərˌmastər|*  
  noun  
  1. a military officer responsible for providing quarters, rations, clothing, and other supplies.

James Bond had a quartermaster and his name was Q.

I want this app to be your own personal quartermaster—equipping you with the mental supplies needed to get the job done.

### Feature Requests

I wanted to make an app that did nothing fancy, but did everything right. If you feel your feature is inline with that goal, then please email me at features@quartermaster.io—and thank you!

### Science

Neuroscientists sometimes categorize intelligence into two factors:

1. fluid intelligence
2. crystallized intelligence

The first one sounds pretty awesome, right? We all want lots of that. And there are plenty of apps to help with that. Crystal focuses on the second one - crystallized intelligence. It's for accumulating and then cementing *volumes* of knowledge. That's what we want to build here.

Human memory is unlimited. Take advantage.

### Flashcards As Supplemental Content

You've written a blog post or a book. You're trying to communicate information. You stress and struggle over making the ideas you're trying to communicate sticky. How do I present this information in a well the reader will remember?
