=======

Author: Sean Moubry

This deck teaches the fundamentals of MacRuby--an implementation of Ruby 1.9 directly on top of Mac OS X core technologies such as the Objective-C runtime and garbage collector.

## Background

- Productivity and prototypes
- Ruby style
- Closures (blocks)
- Meta-programming
- RSpec and other test libraries
- Scripting without AppleScript
